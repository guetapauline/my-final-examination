Well honestly speaking, git and github is new for me but as my professor discuss this, i just learned that git and github are very useful in some other matters especially when it comes in other businesses or even academic purposes, so what are the importance of these two, first git is the commonly used version control system so meaning to say it tracks the changes you make to files so you can have a record or a copy of what has been done, it is also makes collaboration in an easiet way by merging into one source, while on the other hand github hots your source code projects in a variety different programming languages, and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration, it is also an open source so you can atleast use it free, you can download the copy of your source code or make changes anytime you want, it provides also a good documentation and can showcase your work and the most important thing is github is repository you can make it public or private, its up to you.
