Concept of git and Github

- So how does git and github totally works or what are the concept if this, in order for you to contribute a project on your github account first you need to fork a project on github or you need to do is to click that fork button and you will get your own personal repository wherein you have to clone it to your computer in order for you to have two repositories,by default when you clone a repository it will save the parent repository under the name origin, so origin on your computer repository will be pointing to your personal Thematic fork on github,you can add as many remotes as you like and call them whatever you like. You could add a remote for everyone else that has also forked Thematic if you want to keep track of their work, you also need to create a topic branch, an example use case for branching is when you are working on a website and have an idea but working on it might break something. Create a branch for your idea, commit your work there and do your testing, and when everything works as intended you merge the branch back into master and when you you create a branch, it will exist only on your local repo unless or until you decide to share it with others. And other repositories might have several branches that you choose to copy and track or decide to leave alone. You can have as many branches as you like,the next concept is commit your work and checkout the files, when you have made some changes that you want to save, you commit them to your repository. Commits are logical chunks of changes that gets saved in sequence, forming a history that you later can go through and if you want to see how the files of your project looked at any point, you can checkout them. You can use the hash-tags of a commit as a reference, but most common is to use branch names or tags.The last one concept is to full, fetch and merge, you fetch information from upstream and merge those changes into your own repository.
